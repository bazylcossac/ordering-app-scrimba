# ordering-app-scrimba

It's a scrimba project namely ORDERING APP - SCRIMBA

Project should use a local file with data but i've made it a little bit funnier and connected it with firebase realtime database

You have may noticed that in some point of code, im making a variable newid and it contains a random number for an id purpose.
I know UUID exists, i tried to install it by npm but its seems like it is free no more.

I've created a function that adds a new meal to database, its ready to use and i've made a little tutorial to how to use it

Some pics of app:
