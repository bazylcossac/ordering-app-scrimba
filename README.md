# ordering-app-scrimba

It's a Scrimba project, namely ORDERING APP - SCRIMBA.

The project should use a local file with data, but I've made it a little bit more interesting by connecting it to a Firebase Realtime Database.

You may have noticed that at some point in the code, I'm creating a variable called newId which contains a random number for identification purposes.
I know UUID exists; I tried to install it via npm, but it seems like it is no longer free.

I've created a function that adds a new meal to the database. It's ready to use, and I've included a brief tutorial on how to use it.

Some screenshots of the app:
